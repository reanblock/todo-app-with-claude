## Data Storage

All chore data is stored in the browser's `localStorage` under the key `chore-app-data`. The storage schema includes:

```javascript
{
  version: 1,
  templates: [],        // Recurring chore definitions
  instances: [],        // Generated and one-off chores
  deletedInstances: [], // Soft-deleted recurring instances
  settings: {
    weekStartsOn: 0     // 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday
  }
}
```

### Clearing Data
To reset all data, open the browser console and run:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('chore-app-data')
```
